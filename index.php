                        <p class="is-medium">My name is Aaron Madhavan, and I am a Front End web developer.  I have experience building PHP and WordPress websites and have gained experience through freelancing, and my previous employers at Johns Hopkins University, Smart Solutions, LLC and KE Hardware. I am currently a Website Specialist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  In this position, I maintain our existing site,  as well as build or assist clients to update their sites in SiteExecutive or Drupal. </p>
                        <p class="is-medium">I have always had an affinity for computers, which led me to pursue a degree in Web development from the TechLeap program. After completing my studies, I began searching for my first position as a professional web developer. About 9 months after completing school I was given the opportunity to join Gannett Government Media as a Jr. Web Developer. After leaving GGMC, I freelanced and worked for an Agency before coming to Johns Hopkins University.</p>
