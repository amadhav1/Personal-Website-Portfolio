                            <p class="is-size-6">My name is Aaron Madhavan, and I am freelance web developer. I have 7 years of experience building PHP and WordPress websites. I have gained experience through freelancing, and my previous employers at John's Hopkins University, Smart Solutions, LLC. Smart Solutions and KE Hardware. My first development position was as one of two Web Developers at Gannett Government Media Corp. I received my training in the TechLEAP program at Montgomery College.</p>
                            <p class="is-size-6">I have always had an affinity for computers, which led me to pursue a degree in Web development from the TechLeap program. After completing my studies, I began searching for my first position as a professional web developer. About 9 months after completing school I was given the opportunity to join Gannett Government Media as a Jr. Web Developer. After being in this position for two years my title was changed to web developer. I was with GGMC for a little under three years, in this position I increased my skills through the various projects that I worked on. If you visit the examples page you will be able to see some of my work.</p>
